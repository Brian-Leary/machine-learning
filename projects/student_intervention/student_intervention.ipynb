    "\n",
    "Gaussian Naive Bayes (GaussianNB):\n",
    "- Naive Bayes Classifiers are commonly used in text classification, word processing, business analysis and marketing. A well known use would be a spam filter for email.\n",
    "- Even faster than linear models, good for very large datasets and high-dimensional data.\n",
    "- Often less accurate than linear models.\n",
    "- Good for this project because Naive Bayes Classifiers do well with data in which the inputs are independent from one another. \n",
    "\n",
    "Decision Trees:\n",
    "- Decision Trees have been used in computer vision, robotics, control systems, video games and medical analysis. Binary search trees (B-trees), a special type of binary tree, are commonly used to store data in databases.\n",
    "- Decision Trees are very fast, don’t need scaling of the data; can be visualized and easily explained.\n",
    "- Downsides are that you don't get random access and performance times are on average and rely on the tree being balanced.\n",
    "- DecisionTreeClassifier could be a good option here because the dataset is small and by using Stratified Shuffle Split (SSS) we can correct the imbalance of the training data (265 passed; 130 failed).\n",
    "\n",
    "K-Nearest Neighbors (KNeighbors):\n",
    "- kNN has been used for OCR (optical character recognition) by extracting the features of characters/numbers and matching them up with their nearest known (labeled) neighbor. A common use is for recommending products to consumers based on preferences of customers similar to them.\n",
    "- For small datasets, kNN is good as a baseline and easy to explain.\n",
    "- Weaknesses: Need to give a good similarity measure which may not be known apriori; query/prediction cost is high depending on the value of k chosen; curse of dimensionality.\n",
    "- Good for this project to set up a quick and simple algorithm since the training set is quite small, so we can try out kNN for fast prediction times.\n",
    "\n",
    "Logistic Regression:\n",
    "- The Injury Severity Score (ISS) would be a good example of a real world application of logistic regression (which is what was used when it was originally developed. It correlates with mortality, morbidity and hospitalization time after trauma.\n",
    "- Go-to as a first algorithm to try, good for very large datasets; good for very high-dimensional data.\n",
    "- Linear model and cannot capture any complex relationships between the data and the target variable. It is a high bias model and given sufficient data, other more complex models with less bias may outperform it. Logistic regression cannot predict continuous outcomes.\n",
    "- Logistic Regression is easy to apply and a solid baseline to compare other more complex methods. Thus, it should be the first thing to start with when looking for an optimal classifier.\n",

    "-Random Forests:\n",
    "Nearly always perform better than a single decision tree, very robust and powerful. Don’t need scaling of data. Not good for very high-dimensional, sparse data.\n",

    "\n",

Remember that you will need to train and predict on each classifier for three different training set sizes: 100, 200, and 300. Hence, you should expect to have 9 different outputs below — 3 for each model using the varying training set sizes. In the following code cell, you will need to implement the following:\n",

    "I would choose Logistic Regression (LR) for the classifier. It has the highest test F1 score when using a training set size of 200, as well as when using the full training set. SVC has somewhat competitive test F1 scores but it takes significantly longer to train and make predictions. LR is faster and it's a less complex model, suitable for the data in hand (majority of the data is linearly separable). The table above confirms that it is the fastest of all the models in terms of prediction time and its superior accuracy over kNN outweighs its longer training time. Also, LR's spread between F1 scores on training and test sets are the lowest. This is an indicator that LR is not overfitting to the small training set as much as some of the other models."

    "The Logistic Regression model is able to predict how likely a student is to graduate. It does so by analyzing the 395-student data (that have already been through the program). By looking at the attributes of these students, our model can identify cues that have been idicative of failing to graduate in the past. We can look for these cues in future students to get our intervention system.\n",

This is quite intuitive and a rather obvious relationship. What our model does is expand on this idea and look for more subtle, less obvious relationships and patterns, using many more variables than just absences. Because we have detailed records on previous students and we know whether each of those students passed or failed, we can use this information to train our model on what a passing student and what a failing student \"looks like\" so to speak. The model will identify predictive factors and assign weights (higher for those with more influence; less for those with less influence on the outcome) to each and evaluate their influence on the outcome of each of the former students. That's the formal training process. Once that's done we can feed it records of existing students and our model can develop a probability of failure for each current student. If the probability of failure is above a certain threshold the model will identify that student as one in need of additional guidance. Put simply, we will train our model to recognize and identify students who appear to be similar to past students that have failed to graduate.\n",

    "Over time, and with more student records entered, this model will continue to \"learn\" and get better and better at predicting which students are at risk of not graduating."
